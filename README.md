## Git-Search
This application makes it easy to find users and repositories on Github.

## By Sheilla Njoroge

## Description
This application allows a user to search for a Github's user and or repositories by using Github's API. A user first sees my Github account on the /home page and repositories listed on the /repositories page. The user can serach for a user or repo on the search bar up top. With one caveat however. ~Being on the homepage one can search for users only, and being on the repositories pagas well can only search for repositories.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
git clone https://github.com/sheillanjoroge/Git-Search.git
cd Git-Search

## Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.

## Known Bugs
When a user searches for a user or repos, they only get the top result displayed. The current design does not allow for that but can be done.

## Technologies Used
TypeScript
Angular
Bootstrap
